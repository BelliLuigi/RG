# Notes of General Relativity 

## For the Astrophysics & Cosmology / Physics of Data Master Degrees in Padua

### Prof. Francesco D'Eramo, year 2024/2025

I'm uploading all the *.tex* files because I'm using more than one machine. If you just need to consult the notes see [the PDF](main.pdf).  

These notes relies heavily on Carroll's textbook, but I think they could be useful anyway because are tailored on prof. D'Eramo's lessons. 

If you find these notes useful feel free to use and distribute them, on the other hand, if you discover some errors/inaccuracies please let me know about it.

**Disclaimer**: I don't guarantee that what is written here is correct.
