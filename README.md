I'm uploading all the *.tex* files because I work across multiple machines. If you just need to consult the notes, please refer to [the PDF](gr_notes.pdf).  

These notes rely heavily on Carroll's textbook, but I think they could still be useful as they are tailored to prof. D'Eramo's lessons. 

If you find these notes helpful, feel free to use and share them. On the other hand, if you come across any errors or inaccuracies, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know.

**Disclaimer**: I don't guarantee the accuracy of the content in these notes..
