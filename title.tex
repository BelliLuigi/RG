These notes rely heavily on Carroll's textbook, but I think they could still be useful as they are tailored to prof. D'Eramo's lessons. 

If you find these notes helpful, feel free to use and share them. On the other hand, if you come across any errors or inaccuracies, I'd appreciate it if you could let me know.\par
