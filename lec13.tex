\section{Lec 13}
This lecture is about establishing if spacetime is curved or not. We already attempt at this but failed:
\begin{itemize}
\item metric depends on the curvature
\item $\Gamma ^{\alpha }_{\beta \gamma } = 0$
\end{itemize}
Today we will develop an actual way to determine curvature of spacetime independently on coordinates chosen. This way is the \emph{Riemann Tensor.}\par

\subsubsection{Quick recall on LIC}
Local Inertial coordinates. Given a generic spacetime with generic coordinates system $x^{\mu }$ and metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu }$, for a given spacetime point \emph{P} we can find LIC $x^{\hat{\mu }}$. \par
So LIC at \emph{P} 
\begin{equation}
g_{\hat{\mu }\hat{\nu }} \left( P \right) = \eta _{\hat{\mu }\hat{\nu }}	
\end{equation}
obviously this is valid only in \emph{P}. Also $\partial_{\hat{\rho }} g_{\hat{\mu }\hat{\nu }} \left( P \right) = 0$

\subsubsection{Exponential Map}

Geodesics provide a convenient way of mapping the tangent space $T_{P}$ of a point $P$ to a region of the manifold that contains \emph{P}, called the \textbf{exponential map}. This map defines a set of coordinates for this region that are automatically the LIC, local inertial coordinates. \par
These is only one geodesic such that 
\[
x^{\mu }\left( \lambda = 0 \right) \to P
\]
Given a vector $k \in T_{P}$, it defines a unique geodesic passing through it, for which \emph{k} is the tangent vector at $P$, and $\lambda \left( P \right) = 0$:
\[
\frac{d x^{\mu }}{d \lambda } \left( \lambda =0 \right) \to k
\]
The uniqueness is given from the fact that the geodesic equation is a second order differential equation, and specifying the initial data in the form as above determines a solution.\par
So the exponential map at \emph{P}, so given a point in spacetime  
\begin{equation}
exp_{P} : T_{P} \to M
\end{equation}
is a map from the tangent space to a point on the manifold \emph{M}. And is defined as
\begin{equation}
exp_{P}\left( k \right) = x^{\mu }\left( \lambda =1 \right) \to Q
\end{equation}

The exponential map is invertible.

\subsection{Riemann Normal Coordinates}
Given a generic $g_{\mu \nu }$ and a point \emph{P}, first I can find vectors $\hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\mu } \right)}$, (where the hat on the \emph{e} means that it is a basis vector and the hat on the index is means that is of inertial coordinates.)\par
Those are requirements to 
\[
g_{\hat{\mu }\hat{\nu }} =  g\left( \hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\mu } \right)}, \hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\nu } \right)} \right) = \eta _{\hat{\mu }\hat{\nu }}
\]
Where the \emph{g( , )} denotes the metric thought as a multilinear map from $T_{P} \times T_{P} \to \mathbb{R}$. This is easy because starting with any set of components for $g_{\mu \nu }$ we can always diagonalize this matrix and rescale the basis vectors to satisfy the above relation.\par
Now we want to find a coordinates system and to do that we will use the exponential map.
Let's define coordinates 
\begin{gather*}
x_{P} = 0 \\
x_{Q} = x^{\hat{\mu }}_{Q} \hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\mu } \right)} = k^{\hat{\mu }} \hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\mu } \right)}
\end{gather*}
where $x^{\hat{\mu }}_{Q}$ is the inverse of \emph{exp\textsubscript{P}}, \emph{x\textsubscript{Q}} is the position vector and it is represented as a linear combination of basis vectors.\par
So, RNC are $x_{Q } = k^{\mu } \hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\mu } \right)}$, and a particular property is that in this coordinates system 
\[
x^{\hat{\mu }}\left( \lambda  \right) = \lambda k^{\hat{\mu }}
\]
is a geodesic, only in these coordinates.
\subsubsection{More in deep explanation}
Now, I understand that if this is the first time approaching this it's kinda difficult to get the point. 
The part that makes the exponential map useful is that it's hard to find a coordinates system $x^{\hat{\mu }}$ for which the basis vectors $\{ \hat{e}_{\left( h\mu  \right)}\}$ are made of $\hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\mu } \right)} = \partial_{\hat{\mu } }$m and such that the first partial derivatives of $g_{\hat{\mu }\hat{\nu }}$ vanish. But the exponential map achieves that automatically. For any point \emph{Q} sufficiently close to \emph{P}, there is a unique geodesic path connecting \emph{P} to \emph{Q}, and a unique parametrization $\lambda $. At \emph{P} the tangent vector can be written as a linear combination of our basis vectors $k = k^{\hat{\mu }} \hat{e}_{\left( \hat{\mu } \right)}$. Then we define $x^{\hat{\mu }}$ to be these components $x^{\hat{\mu }}\left( Q \right) = k^{\hat{\mu }}$
